        hey’re bright and colorful and packed with all sorts of tasty things that will leave everyone very satisfied. We used a homemade tofu and walnut vegan taco meat as well as black beans for the protein, some pico de gallo salsa, shredded lettuce, chopped avocado and a fabulous tahini sauce to drizzle over the top. Preparing this recipe involves a few different elements but once they’re all made, assembling everything is super fun.

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            If you're making the vegan taco meat then start off with that since it has to bake for 30 minutes. So make that according to the linked recipe and get that in the oven and then start on your black beans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chopped onion to a pan along with the olive oil, crushed garlic, cayenne pepper, chili flakes and ground cumin and sauté until the onions are softened. Add in the black beans and sauté with the onions and spices until heated through. If it’s getting too dry in the pan then add in a little water. Add salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare your pico de gallo and your tahini sauce according to the linked recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare your shredded lettuce and chopped avocado.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat your tortillas via your preferred method, or by lightly frying in a pan or stacking them up and covering in foil and baking in the oven at 350°F (180°C) for around 15 minutes until heated through.
